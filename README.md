## 🎯 What It Does

Enter your AI infrastructure needs and see **exactly** how much you save by choosing Raspberry Pi over NVIDIA:

- **Real-time calculations** (no page reload)
- **5-year TCO projections** (hardware + electricity + infrastructure)
- **CO2 emissions comparison** (NVIDIA vs solar-powered Pi)
- **Savings breakdown** (what you could do with the money saved)

## 📊 Example Results

| Scenario | Nodes | Years | NVIDIA Cost | Pi Cost | **Savings** |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Solo Dev | 1 | 5 | $7,000 | $180 | **$6,820** (97% cheaper) |
| Startup | 5 | 3 | $32,000 | $700 | **$31,300** (10+ months runway) |
| School | 50 | 5 | $333,000 | $6,700 | **$326,300** (488 more Pis!) |
| Enterprise | 100 | 5 | $667,000 | $13,400 | **$653,600** (44 engineers!) |

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Interactive inputs** (nodes, years, electricity cost, use case)
- ✅ **Real-time updates** (instant recalculation)
- ✅ **Beautiful UI** (BlackRoad design system)
- ✅ **Fully responsive** (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- ✅ **Shareable** (send link with your calculations)

## 🛠️ Technology

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (no frameworks, no build step)
- **BlackRoad Design System** (Amber #F5A623, Hot Pink #FF1D6C, Electric Blue #2979FF)
- **Responsive** (works on all devices)
- **Fast** (< 16KB total)

## 📖 How It Works

The calculator compares total cost of ownership (TCO) between:

### NVIDIA Approach (Centralized)
- Hardware: $3,000 desktop + $2,000 GPU + $500 setup
- Power: 500W per unit (expensive electricity)
- Cooling: $200/year infrastructure
- Result: **Expensive, centralized, vendor lock-in**

### BlackRoad Pi Approach (Distributed)
- Hardware: $75 Pi 5 + $10 power + $20 SD + $15 case
- Power: 15W per unit (solar viable)
- Cooling: $0 (runs cool)
- Result: **Affordable, distributed, full sovereignty**

## 🌍 Why This Matters

**NVIDIA's vision:** AI for the 1% who can afford it  
**BlackRoad's vision:** AI for the 99% everywhere

This calculator proves with **math** that distributed Pi infrastructure beats centralized NVIDIA for:
- ✅ Cost (93%+ savings)
- ✅ Power efficiency (97% less)
- ✅ Carbon footprint (100% reduction with solar)
- ✅ Sovereignty (you own it)
- ✅ Scalability (horizontal > vertical)
